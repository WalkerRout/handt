# Hand Tracker
> Using Python and OpenCV

### Description
This project is used for tracking a user's hands. So far, it is possible to adjust the volume according to the distance between the tip of the index finger and thumb. Adjusting the volume only works for macOS, as the script is using osascript to set the output volume.

I used OpenCV due to the scalable, simple, and cross platform nature of the library. MediaPipe is used for processing the images from the webcam.
